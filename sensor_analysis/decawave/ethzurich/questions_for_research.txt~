CRUCIAL POINTS
1) What is the bit order? Unknown from Eth code
2) Setup the spi for standard 8 bit data and SPI-Mode 0
	Not entirely sure what SPI-Mode 0 is, it's unclear based on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus#Mode_numbers. For now just going with the Arduino defined SPI_MODE0	
3) Set frequency between 1 million (standard) and 49 million
4) Set slave select low to start transmission, set it high to end transmission


What is SPI.Transfer? (Ard) How is it related to spi.write? (Eth)
	It appears that SPI.Transfer and spi.write both write a single byte to the bus.



What is all this?
// Interrupt (line 85, DW1000.h)
InterruptIn irq; // Pin used to handle Events from DW1000 by an Interrupthandler
void ISR(); // interrupt handling method (also calls according callback methods)
